Project Overview

This project demonstrates API testing for a basic e-commerce backend using Postman. The collection includes requests for user registration, login, fetching product lists, viewing product details and adding items to a cart.

It is designed to showcase practical skills in:
- Structuring collections
- Using environment and global variables
- Writing pre-request scripts and test scripts
- Running data-driven tests using CSV
- Testing authentication workflows (e.g., JWT token handling)

Ideal for QA engineers, software testers, or API developers building and testing RESTful services.
